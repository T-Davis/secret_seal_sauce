With only about 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals left in the world and their population much lower than historic levels, each seal (especially young and reproductive females) influences population growth or extinction. Accurately identifying and tracking individual seals allow scientists to conserve the species by:

         Monitoring population trends and evaluating threats.
	        Tracking the success and effectiveness of population enhancement activities.
	        Investigating monk seal diseases and parasites.
	        Understanding patterns of sick, entangled, hooked, and/or injured seals.

To address challenges such as the expansive and remote locations of HMS and the range of ecological and human-caused threats, NOAA uses a range of innovative conservation and management strategies:

         Responding to monk seal haul-outs [description] and strandings [description].
	        Providing outreach and education, and fostering a culture of human-seal coexistence.
	        Protecting habitat and designating critical habitat.
	        Ensuring natural population growth and reducing human-seal interactions.
	        Supporting monk seal rehabilitation and veterinary care.
	        Vaccinating wild Hawaiian monk seals against morbillivirus.
	        Translocating weaned pups from areas with high risk of Galapagos shark predation to safer islets.
	        Addressing injuries and mortalities caused by aggressive male seals.

About 30% of the Hawaiian monk seal population is alive today thanks to the recovery actions and interventions of NOAA Fisheries, such as disentanglement, rehabilitation, and more.
